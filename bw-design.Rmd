## What are my learning objectives for the audience members?

1. Increase awareness of my test & its R package & R package's presence on github

2. Recognize the role of relatedness in the model and in calculating the test statistic

3. Recognize the inadequacies of previous tests (of pleiotropy vs separate QTL) and appreciate the need for a test that works with multiparental populations

4. Address the relationship between testing pleiotropy vs separate QTL and dissection of causal pathways




## Ideas & Questions

what to say about ease of use? Duration of calculations?

** Need a slide to demo package install from github? **
